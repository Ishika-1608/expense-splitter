🧮 Algorithms & Logic
Simplified Settlement Algorithm
The app uses a greedy algorithm to minimize transaction count:

1. Calculate net balance for each person
2. Separate into debtors (negative balance) and creditors (positive balance)
3. Sort both lists in descending order
4. Match largest debtor with largest creditor
5. Settle minimum of (debt, credit)
6. Repeat until all balanced

Example:

Alice paid $60, owes 20→Net:+40
Bob paid $30, owes 50→Net:−20
Charlie paid $10, owes 30→Net:−20
Simplified:

Bob → Alice: $20
Charlie → Alice: $20
Instead of 6 possible transactions!

Balance Calculation

def calculate_balances(group):
    for split in unsettled_splits:
        if split.user != split.expense.paid_by:
            balances[split.user][split.expense.paid_by] += split.amount_owed
    return balances

🚀 Deployment Guide
Deploy to Render (Free)
1. Prepare for production:

pip install gunicorn psycopg2-binary whitenoise
pip freeze > requirements.txt

2. Update settings.py:

import os
from pathlib import Path

DEBUG = os.getenv('DEBUG', 'False') == 'True'
ALLOWED_HOSTS = os.getenv('ALLOWED_HOSTS', 'localhost').split(',')

# Database
import dj_database_url
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.config(
        default='sqlite:///db.sqlite3',
        conn_max_age=600
    )
}

# Static files
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'

3. Create build.sh:

#!/usr/bin/env bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py collectstatic --no-input
python manage.py migrate

4. Push to GitHub

5. On Render.com:

  New → Web Service
  Connect GitHub repository
  Build Command: ./build.sh
  Start Command: gunicorn expense_project.wsgi:application
  Add environment variables (SECRET_KEY, DEBUG=False)

Environment Variables

  SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
  DEBUG=False
  ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourapp.onrender.com
  DATABASE_URL=postgresql://... (Render provides this)
